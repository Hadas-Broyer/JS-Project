            <h3>Game Instructions </h3>
            <p>
                The goal of the game is to blow up all the balls at the top.<br>
                At each stage you have a ball of a certain color at your disposal and you must shoot the ball into a group of balls of the same color as that ball.<br>
                Balls explode as a result of at least three adjacent balls of the same color<br>
   

            <p>
                How do you play Bubbles?<br>
                Ok, the game is very simple, when we enter the game in the original Abels we see a screen full of colored bubbles and we have one bubble and the possibility to launch it in any direction, note that our bubble also has its own color.<br>
                The goal of the game is to finish all the balls on the screen, how do you do that? Whenever 3 bubbles of the same color touch each other, they will burst and disappear
                . That is, if we have a yellow ball ready to launch, we must look for at least two yellow bubbles on the screen, and we must connect the three of them in order to break the three. Of course, three is the minimum number, you can also blow dozens of Bubbles bubbles together.
                How do you launch a Bubbles bubble?
                The game Bubbles is controlled with the keys, move with the arrows and launch with the enter key. You can launch a bubble / ball in a direct configuration straight to the target,
                In conclusion, the game Bubbles is a very simple game to operate and very fun and addictive
